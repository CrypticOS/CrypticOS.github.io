# CrypticOS
CrypticOS is an operating system designed to be hackable,  
around the "make it and keep it simple" philosophy.  

Currently, the smallest version of the operating system fits  
in 256 bytes.  

The operating system is based entirely around CINS. Read about  
it here: https://github.com/CrypticOS/cins

## History
CrypticOS started out as an idea for a MIT Scratch operating system.  
When the project died, I evolved the original ideas to make it a real OS.  

Note: I was part of the CrypticOS project, and I have permission from the  
project owner to continue it under the new ideas.
