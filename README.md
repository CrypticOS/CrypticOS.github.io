# CrypticOS
CrypticOS is an operating system written in the most  
difficult and bizarre way possible. It's implemented  
in a custom assembly language, which runs on a  
custom architecture.  

Currently, the smallest emulator fits in 256 bytes.  

The bytecode is called CINS. Read about it here:

## History
CrypticOS started out as an idea for a MIT Scratch operating system.  
When the project died, I evolved the original ideas to make it a real OS.  

Note: I was part of the CrypticOS project, and I have permission from the  
project owner to continue it under the new ideas.
